# Third-party components

OTKGlobeEngine's own code is under the Apache License 2.0 ([LICENSE](../LICENSE)): use it for anything, change it and sell it, in open or closed products, without having to share your changes. Copies you pass on keep the license text, and files you changed say so.

The libraries and data built into the engine keep their own licenses. Most are public domain or zlib and ask for nothing. The MIT, ISC, BSD and Apache ones ask that their license text ships with copies of the software. Putting this file and the linked license texts in a product's "licenses" screen or folder covers that. Nothing here requires naming OTKGlobeEngine.

Build tools that do not end up in the binary (CMake, Ninja, sokol-shdc) are not listed.

The online map services that the demo presets point at (Esri World Imagery, OpenStreetMap, USGS, NASA GIBS, AWS Terrain Tiles) have their own terms of use, for example OpenStreetMap's attribution requirement. Those apply to using the services, not to the engine's code; an airgapped deployment with its own data is not affected.
